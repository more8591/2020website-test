# Victor's Website Portfolio 2020 Test
A little about what I'm doing with this...
I wanted to prove my skills in website development by creating a stylistic and original website that reflects my own tastes. At the same time, this will be a good opportunity to display my full skillset such as being able to do graphic design, host a podcast, direct entertainment media, voice acting and other.
